While working with the vi editor, we usually come across the following two modes −

    Command mode − This mode enables you to perform administrative tasks such as saving the files, executing the commands, moving the cursor, cutting (yanking) and pasting the lines or words, as well as finding and replacing. In this mode, whatever you type is interpreted as a command.

    Insert mode − This mode enables you to insert text into the file. Everything that's typed in this mode is interpreted as input and placed in the file.
