----Connectors----

Connector 	Modern Web Examples

client ->	libwww, libwww-perl
server ->	libwww, Apache API, NSAPI
cache ->	browser cache, Akamai cache network
resolver(A resolver translates partial or complete resource identifiers into the network address information needed to establish an inter-component connection) ->	bind (DNS lookup library)
tunnel(simply relays communication across a connection boundary, such as a firewall or lower-level network gateway) ->	SOCKS, SSL after HTTP CONNECT

----Components----

Intermediary components act as both a client and a server in order to forward, with possible translation, requests and responses

origin server ->	Apache httpd, Microsoft IIS
gateway  -> 	Squid, CGI, Reverse Proxy
proxy ->	CERN Proxy, Netscape Proxy, Gauntlet
user agent -> 	Netscape Navigator, Lynx, MOMspider
