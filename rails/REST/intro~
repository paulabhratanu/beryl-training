REST="representational state transfer"
resource-based(noun based)
representations(not a resource;representation of a resource)
Six constraints:
 ->uniform interface
 ->stateless
 ->client-server
 ->cacheable
 ->layered system
 ->code on demand

----Representations----
->How resources get manipulated
->resource state transferred between client and server
->JSON or XML
eg:
   *Resource: person(amit)
   *Service: contact information(GET)
   *representation:
     ->name,address,phone no
     ->JSON or XML

----Uniform Interface----
->interface between client and server
->simplifies the architecture
->HTTP verbs(GET,PUT,POST,DELETE)
->URIs(resource name)
->HTTP response(status,body)

----Stateless----
->Server contains no client state
->Each request contains enough context to process the message
->Any session state is held on the client

----Client-Server----
->Assume a disconnected system
->uniorm interface is the link between the two

----Cacheable----
->server responses are cacheable

----Layered system----
->client can't assume direct connection to server
->improves scalability

----Code on demand----
->javascript
